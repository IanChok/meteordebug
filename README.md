### Bug Report 
- This repo demonstrates the **app crash** when importing a folder component that contains a `index.tsx` and `index.css` for a _React_ frontend with _typescript_.
- In _imports/ui/Component, if you rename the `index.css` file to something else, such as `indexx.css` the app then no longer crashes

Meteor version 2.4
